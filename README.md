# Model.iv: Student Performance Predictor

## Introduction
**Model.iv** is a simple **Student Performance Predictor** tool that demonstrates the basic concepts of machine learning using linear regression. It predicts a student's grade based on the number of hours they study. The project aims to help users understand how linear regression works and how it can be implemented using JavaScript.
